##Live Demo : https://mohammed-nasif.github.io/Nexus-Software-Website/
## Github Repo: https://github.com/Mohammed-Nasif/Nexus-Software-Website
---
### Instructions:

	- This Website is not responsive on all Screen Types so it's Recommended When you open it to adjust 
	  your Browser zoom Level Between (80%, 90%, 100%). It will looks nice when navBar shows 
	  all centered on the same line.

	- If you want to run project locally please try to open the project with live server if it's available to load the style correctly.

Thank You ^^...
